Q1(-5): 

To compute the new representation in concept space, you don't need to divide singular values.  

As for the cosine similarities in new concept space, you should use A or C dot V instead of use vectors inside U.

Q2a(-5): You should show the energy kept ratio.

Q2b(-7): You should display “the images” corresponding to the top 64 principal vectors instead of distribution visualization.

Q3a(-8): For Item-Item Collaborative Filtering, the two closest neighbors are Book C and Book A, prediction will be (0.307729*2+0.175882*4) / (0.307729+0.175882) = 2.727370.

For User-user collaboration filtering, the two closest neighbors are User 1 and User 2, and the prediction will be (0.707107*3+0*5) / (0.707107+0) = 3.

To modify your code correctly, you should compare it to the content of slide for recommendation system.
